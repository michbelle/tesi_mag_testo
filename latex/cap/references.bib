	abstract="We describe a novel navigation and control system designed for industrial unmanned ground vehicles, utilizing the Robot Operating System (ROS). Our primary objective was to develop a versatile solution that could adapt to various chassis and robot configurations. The system is characterized by its modularity, reconfigurability, flexibility, and partial hardware/system environment agnosticism. It combines modern SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques, advanced trajectory planning algorithms, and robust AI image processing capabilities, all accessible through a user-friendly web frontend. The paper delves into the system's architecture and its seamless integration with the mechanical components. Additionally, it describes some challenges encountered during the implementation of this advanced software, its architecture and interaction with the mechanical part of the system.",

It contains description of the novel ROS module that implements adopted version of the known and well described D-star (D*) algorithm accompanied with customized heuristic, and optimizer pipeline for trajectory decompaction, and postprocessing engine for holding a safety distance from the obstacles. The module removes the known problems that D-star experiences on high-resolution maps, providing sparse trajectory useful for the industrial unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) with simple actuation trackers installed. Test results of the algorithm are given for the dense industrial environment containing closed loops.",
